# Leukaemia-Classification

Acute leukemia is a proliferation of immature bone marrow-derived cells (blasts) that
may also involve peripheral blood or solid organs.
The percentage of bone marrow blast cells required for a diagnosis of acute leukemia
has traditionally been set arbitrarily at 30% or more.
With the help of machine learning, patterns in genetic data can be found that were
unknown to us earlier and these patterns can be very useful in making conclusions
about diseases and disorders that are inherently genetic in nature.
It highlights the need for effective techniques to analyze gene expression data and
explores the limitations of traditional methods. PCA is then introduced as a valuable
tool for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data visualization. The
underlying mathematical principles of PCA are explained, including the calculation
of eigenvalues and eigenvector.

The main focus of the presentation is on applying PCA to gene expression datasets. It
delves into the step-by-step process of performing PCA, starting from data
preprocessing, normalization, and scaling, to generating the principal components and
analyzing their contributions to the variance. Real-world examples and case studies
are presented to illustrate the practical application of PCA in gene expression analysis.



With the increasing availability of gene expression datasets, the need for effective
feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques becomes crucial. Extracting
meaningful patterns and interactions from high-dimensional gene expression data poses
significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and resource requirements.
The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms and Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) to classify leukemia subtypes based on gene expression
profiles while addressing these challenges. The successful completion of this project
will contribute to the field of leukemia classification by providing an accurate and
efficient machine learning-based system for subtype identification. The results obtained
will aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions for effective diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment planningfor leukemia patients.
